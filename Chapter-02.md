1. **What is NPM?**
    
    NPM is Node Package Manager (not a full form). It is a package manager for JavaScript, widely used for managing and sharing packages of code. NPM is primarily associated with Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment for server-side programming, but it can also be used for front-end development and other JavaScript-based projects.
    
    Here are some key aspects of NPM:
    
    1. **Package Management**: NPM allows developers to install, publish, and manage packages of JavaScript code. These packages can include libraries, frameworks, tools, utilities, and more.
    2. **Dependency Management**: NPM manages dependencies between packages by tracking the dependencies specified in a project's **`package.json`** file. When a package is installed, NPM automatically installs its dependencies, ensuring that the project has access to all the required dependencies.
    3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: NPM provides a command-line interface that developers use to interact with the NPM registry and manage packages. Common commands include **`npm install`** to install packages, **`npm init`** to initialize a new project, **`npm publish`** to publish a package to the registry, and many others.
    4. **Registry**: NPM maintains a public registry that hosts millions of packages of open-source JavaScript code. Developers can publish their packages to the registry, making them available for others to discover and use.
    5. **Versioning**: NPM uses semantic versioning (SemVer) to manage package versions. Each package has a version number consisting of three parts: major, minor, and patch. Developers can specify version ranges or exact versions of dependencies in their projects' **`package.json`** files to control which versions are installed.
    
    Overall, NPM plays a central role in the JavaScript ecosystem, providing a convenient and efficient way for developers to share, discover, and manage reusable code packages. It has become an essential tool for JavaScript developers working on a wide range of projects, from web applications to server-side APIs and more.
    
    1. **What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?**
        
        Parcel and Webpack are both popular bundlers for JavaScript applications, commonly used in modern web development. 
        
        Why do we need bundlers like Parcel or Webpack?
        
        - **Dependency Management**: Bundlers help manage dependencies between modules and packages in JavaScript applications. They ensure that all required modules are bundled together in the correct order, optimizing performance and reducing loading times.
        - **Code Transformation**: Bundlers can transform and preprocess code using tools like Babel (for transpiling modern JavaScript to older versions for wider browser compatibility), PostCSS (for processing CSS with plugins), and others.
        - **Asset Optimization**: Bundlers optimize assets by minifying code, compressing images, and bundling resources to reduce file sizes and improve performance.
        - **Code Splitting**: Bundlers support code splitting, allowing applications to load only the code needed for a particular page or feature, which improves initial load times and reduces the amount of code transferred over the network.
        
        In summary, Parcel and Webpack are bundlers used in web development to simplify the process of bundling and optimizing assets, managing dependencies, and enhancing the performance of JavaScript applications. They are essential tools for modern web development workflows, enabling developers to build efficient and scalable applications.
        
    
    3.  **What is .parcel-cache?**
    
    The **`.parcel-cache`** directory is a folder created by Parcel bundler during the build process of a web application. It serves as a cache directory where Parcel stores cached data and intermediate build artifacts to improve build performance and avoid unnecessary recompilations.
    
    Here's what you need to know about the **`.parcel-cache`** directory:
    
    1. **Cache Storage**: Parcel uses the **`.parcel-cache`** directory to store cached data related to various build processes. This includes compiled JavaScript bundles, processed CSS files, optimized images, and other generated assets.
    2. **Performance Optimization**: By caching build artifacts, Parcel can avoid recompiling files that have not changed since the last build. This significantly improves build performance, especially during incremental builds where only a subset of files have been modified.
    3. **Reusability**: The cached data stored in the **`.parcel-cache`** directory can be reused across multiple builds. This means that if you make changes to your project's source code and trigger a new build, Parcel will first check the cache to see if any previously compiled assets can be reused, saving time and resources.
    4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Parcel automatically manages the contents of the **`.parcel-cache`** directory, cleaning up outdated or unused cache entries as needed. This helps prevent the directory from consuming excessive disk space over time.
    5. **Project-specific**: Each Parcel project has its own **`.parcel-cache`** directory, which is typically located in the root directory of the project. This ensures that cached data is isolated and specific to each project, preventing conflicts between different projects using Parcel.
    
    In summary, the **`.parcel-cache`** directory is a cache directory used by the Parcel bundler to store cached data and intermediate build artifacts. It helps improve build performance by avoiding unnecessary recompilations and reusing cached data across multiple builds.
    
    1. **What is `npx` ?**
        
        **`npx`** is a command-line utility that comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager) starting from npm version 5.2.0. It stands for "Node Package Runner" and is used to execute Node.js packages directly without having to install them globally or locally.
        
        Here are some key points about **`npx`**:
        
        1. **Execution of Packages**: **`npx`** allows you to execute any Node.js package that is available in the npm registry or installed locally in your project's **`node_modules`** directory. You can run a package by specifying its name directly in the command line.
        2. **Execution of Binaries**: **`npx`** can also be used to run binaries from packages installed in your project's **`node_modules`** directory. If a package provides executable commands (binaries), you can run them directly using **`npx`**.
        3. **Package Version**: By default, **`npx`** will use the latest version of the specified package. However, you can specify a specific version by appending **`@version`** to the package name.
        4. **Local Package Execution**: If a package is not installed locally in your project's **`node_modules`** directory, **`npx`** will automatically install it temporarily and execute it. Once the execution is complete, **`npx`** will remove the temporary installation.
            
            This allows you to run packages without polluting your global npm modules or requiring you to manually install them in your project.
            
        
        In summary, **`npx`** is a convenient tool for executing Node.js packages directly from the command line, without the need for manual installation or management. It simplifies the process of running command-line tools and scripts, making it easier to work with Node.js packages in your projects.
        
    2. What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
        
        In Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), dependencies and devDependencies serve different purposes and are used in different contexts:
        
        1. **Dependencies**:
            - Dependencies are packages that your project depends on in order to run properly in a production environment.
            - These are typically packages that your application requires at runtime to perform its core functionality.
            - Dependencies are installed using the **`npm install`** command without the **`-save-dev`** or **`D`** flag.
            - Examples of dependencies include libraries, frameworks, utilities, or any other packages that are crucial for the operation of your application.
        2. **DevDependencies**:
            - DevDependencies, short for development dependencies, are packages that are only needed during the development and testing phases of your project.
            - These are typically packages that are used for development tasks such as building, testing, linting, and code formatting.
            - DevDependencies are installed using the **`npm install`** command with the **`-save-dev`** or **`D`** flag.
            - Examples of devDependencies include testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha), build tools (e.g., Webpack, Gulp), code linters (e.g., ESLint, JSHint), and other development-specific tools.
        
        Here's a summary of the differences between dependencies and devDependencies:
        
        - **Purpose**: Dependencies are required for your application to run in a production environment, while devDependencies are only needed during development and testing.
        - **Installation**: Dependencies are installed without the **`-save-dev`** or **`D`** flag, while devDependencies are installed with the **`-save-dev`** or **`D`** flag.
        - **Examples**: Dependencies include packages required for your application's core functionality, while devDependencies include packages used for development tasks such as testing, building, and linting.
        
        It's important to distinguish between dependencies and devDependencies and to manage them appropriately in your project's **`package.json`** file. By specifying dependencies and devDependencies separately, you can ensure that your production environment only includes the necessary packages for running your application, while development tools and dependencies remain isolated to the development environment.
        
    3. What is Tree Shaking?
    
        
        Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the context of JavaScript module bundlers, such as Webpack or Rollup. It refers to the process of eliminating dead code (i.e., unused or unreachable code) from a JavaScript bundle during the bundling process. The goal of tree shaking is to reduce the size of the final bundle, improving load times and overall performance of the application.
        
        Here's how tree shaking typically works:
        
        1. **ES Modules**: Tree shaking relies on the static structure of ES modules (ECMAScript modules). ES modules use explicit **`import`** and **`export`** statements to define dependencies between modules, which allows bundlers to analyze and understand the module dependency graph at build time.
        2. **Static Analysis**: During the bundling process, the module bundler performs static analysis of the JavaScript code to identify and track the dependencies between modules. This analysis determines which modules are imported and used by other modules.
        3. **Dead Code Elimination**: After identifying the dependencies, the bundler can eliminate any code that is not referenced or used by the application. This includes functions, variables, or entire modules that are imported but never used in the application.
        4. **Optimized Bundle**: The result of tree shaking is an optimized JavaScript bundle that contains only the code necessary for the application to run. Unused code is removed, resulting in a smaller bundle size and improved performance.
        
        Tree shaking is particularly effective when using libraries or frameworks that provide modularized code, as it allows developers to include only the parts of the library that are actually used in the application. However, tree shaking depends on the ability of the bundler to perform accurate static analysis of the code and properly identify dead code. Additionally, tree shaking is most effective with ES modules, as they have a clear and static dependency structure that can be analyzed by the bundler.
        
        In summary, tree shaking is a technique used by JavaScript module bundlers to eliminate dead code from a bundle, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and improved application performance. It leverages the static structure of ES modules to analyze module dependencies and remove unused code during the bundling process.
        
    4. What is Hot Module Replacement?
        
        Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature commonly used in modern web development, particularly with module bundlers like Webpack. HMR allows developers to update the code of a web application in real-time, without requiring a full page refresh. It enables faster development cycles by preserving the application state and applying changes to the UI dynamically, resulting in a more efficient and interactive development experience.
        
        Here's how Hot Module Replacement typically works:
        
        1. **Module Replacement**: When changes are made to a module (e.g., a JavaScript file, a CSS file, or a template), the module bundler (e.g., Webpack) detects these changes and replaces the outdated module in the running application with the updated one.
        2. **Preservation of Application State**: HMR preserves the application state during the module replacement process. This means that any changes to the code do not cause the application to lose its current state, such as the current page, user input, or other runtime data.
        3. **Partial Updates**: Unlike traditional page refreshes, which reload the entire application, HMR applies changes incrementally and selectively. Only the modules that have been modified are replaced, while the rest of the application remains unaffected. This results in faster update times and a smoother development experience.
        4. **Instant Feedback**: HMR provides instant feedback to developers as they make changes to the code. They can see the effects of their changes immediately in the browser, without having to manually refresh the page or restart the application.
        5. **Integration with Development Server**: HMR typically requires a development server that supports hot module replacement. The development server listens for changes in the codebase and applies them to the running application using HMR.
        
        HMR is commonly used in conjunction with other development tools and practices, such as code splitting, CSS modules, and component-based architecture. It is particularly useful for front-end developers working on complex web applications, enabling them to iterate quickly, experiment with different ideas, and see the results in real-time without disrupting their workflow.
        
    5. What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
        
        **`.gitignore`** is a text file used by Git to specify intentionally untracked files and directories that Git should ignore when tracking changes in a repository. It allows developers to exclude certain files and directories from being included in version control, preventing them from being committed to the repository or showing up in **`git status`** as untracked files.
        
        Here's how **`.gitignore`** works and what should be included in it:
        
        1. **File Format**: **`.gitignore`** is a plain text file with a list of file patterns that Git should ignore. Each pattern is typically listed on a separate line.
        2. **Patterns**: File patterns in **`.gitignore`** can use wildcards and special characters to match files and directories. Commonly used patterns include:
            - **``**: Matches zero or more characters in a filename or directory name.
            - **`?`**: Matches a single character in a filename or directory name.
            - **`/`**: Indicates a directory separator.
            - **`!`**: Negates a pattern, specifying files or directories that should not be ignored.
        3. **Comments**: Lines beginning with **`#`** are treated as comments and are ignored by Git. Comments can be used to provide explanations or context for the patterns listed in the **`.gitignore`** file.
        4. **Directory Entries**: To ignore an entire directory and its contents, you can specify the directory name followed by a trailing slash. For example, **`node_modules/`** will ignore the **`node_modules`** directory and all its contents.
        5. **File Entries**: To ignore specific files, you can specify the filename or file pattern. For example, **`.log`** will ignore all files with the **`.log`** extension.
        
        What to include in **`.gitignore`**:
        
        - Automatically generated files and directories, such as log files, build artifacts, and temporary files.
        - Dependency directories and files, such as **`node_modules/`** in Node.js projects or **`venv/`** in Python projects.
        - IDE and editor-specific files and directories, such as **`.vscode/`** or **`.idea/`**.
        - Configuration files containing sensitive or environment-specific information, such as **`.env`** files.
        
        What not to include in **`.gitignore`**:
        
        - Files that are part of the project's source code and should be tracked by Git, such as source code files, configuration files needed for development, and documentation files.
        - Important files or directories that should be version controlled, such as README files, license files, and configuration files required for the application to run.
        
        It's important to carefully manage the contents of **`.gitignore`** to ensure that only the necessary files and directories are excluded from version control. Including unnecessary files or directories in **`.gitignore`** can lead to unintended consequences and cause issues with the project's version control.
        
    6. What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
        
        **`package.json`** and **`package-lock.json`** are both files used in Node.js projects to manage dependencies, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts:
        
        1. **package.json**:
            - **`package.json`** is a metadata file for Node.js projects that contains various project-specific configurations, including metadata about the project, dependencies, scripts, and other settings.
            - It typically includes information such as the project name, version, description, entry points, scripts, author, and license.
            - One of the main purposes of **`package.json`** is to specify the dependencies required by the project. It includes a **`"dependencies"`** section where production dependencies are listed and a **`"devDependencies"`** section where development dependencies are listed.
            - Developers manually add, update, and remove dependencies in the **`package.json`** file using commands like **`npm install`**, **`npm install <package-name>`**, **`npm uninstall <package-name>`**, etc.
            - **`package.json`** serves as the source of truth for the project's dependencies and configuration. It is typically committed to version control and shared with other developers working on the project.
        2. **package-lock.json**:
            - **`package-lock.json`** is an automatically generated file created by npm that provides a detailed, deterministic, and reproducible record of the exact versions of dependencies installed in a project.
            - It includes information about each installed package, including its name, version, resolved version (i.e., the specific version installed), dependency tree, and integrity checksums.
            - The purpose of **`package-lock.json`** is to ensure that the same versions of dependencies are installed on all machines and environments where the project is run. This helps prevent issues related to dependency version mismatches and ensures consistent builds across different environments.
            - **`package-lock.json`** is automatically generated and updated by npm whenever dependencies are installed or modified using commands like **`npm install`**, **`npm update`**, etc.
            - **`package-lock.json`** should typically be committed to version control along with the **`package.json`** file to ensure that all developers working on the project use the same dependency versions and to provide a reliable and reproducible build environment.
        
        In summary, **`package.json`** is a metadata file that contains project-specific configurations and dependency lists, while **`package-lock.json`** is an automatically generated file that provides a detailed record of exact dependency versions installed in the project. While **`package.json`** is manually maintained by developers, **`package-lock.json`** is automatically generated and updated by npm to ensure consistent and reproducible dependency installations. Both files are important for managing dependencies in Node.js projects and ensuring reliable and consistent builds.
        
    7. Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
        
        Modifying the **`package-lock.json`** file directly is generally not recommended for several reasons:
        
        1. **Automatic Generation**: The **`package-lock.json`** file is automatically generated and maintained by npm or yarn whenever dependencies are installed or modified using commands like **`npm install`**, **`npm update`**, **`yarn add`**, etc. It serves as a detailed record of the exact versions of dependencies installed in the project, including their resolved versions, dependency tree, and integrity checksums.
        2. **Deterministic Builds**: **`package-lock.json`** ensures that the same versions of dependencies are installed on all machines and environments where the project is run. This helps prevent issues related to dependency version mismatches and ensures consistent and reproducible builds across different environments.
        3. **Dependency Resolution**: npm and yarn use the information in **`package-lock.json`** to determine which versions of dependencies to install. Modifying the **`package-lock.json`** file directly can lead to inconsistencies between the actual dependencies installed and the dependencies specified in the file, potentially causing unexpected behavior or breaking the project.
        4. **Version Control**: **`package-lock.json`** is typically committed to version control along with the **`package.json`** file to ensure that all developers working on the project use the same dependency versions. Modifying the **`package-lock.json`** file directly can introduce inconsistencies between different copies of the repository and lead to conflicts during collaboration.
        
        Instead of modifying **`package-lock.json`** directly, it's recommended to manage dependencies using npm or yarn commands (**`npm install`**, **`npm update`**, **`yarn add`**, etc.) and let the package manager automatically update the **`package-lock.json`** file as needed. This ensures that the **`package-lock.json`** file remains accurate and reflects the true state of the project's dependencies, leading to reliable and consistent builds across different environments.
        
    8. What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
        
        **`node_modules`** is a directory created by npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn to store the dependencies of a Node.js project. When you install packages using **`npm install`** or **`yarn install`**, the package manager downloads the specified packages and their dependencies from the npm registry and saves them in the **`node_modules`** directory.
        
        Here are some key points about **`node_modules`**:
        
        1. **Dependencies**: **`node_modules`** contains all the dependencies required by your Node.js project, including both production dependencies (listed in the **`"dependencies"`** section of **`package.json`**) and development dependencies (listed in the **`"devDependencies"`** section of **`package.json`**).
        2. **Nested Structure**: Dependencies in **`node_modules`** are often nested, with each package having its own directory structure containing its code, dependencies, and metadata.
        3. **Package Versions**: Each package installed in **`node_modules`** has its own directory, named after the package name and version number. This ensures that different projects can use different versions of the same package without conflicts.
        4. **Git Ignored by Default**: It is a standard practice not to include the **`node_modules`** directory in version control systems like Git. This is because **`node_modules`** can contain a large number of files and directories, often including binary files, and can significantly increase the size of the repository.
            
            By excluding **`node_modules`** from version control, you ensure that the repository remains smaller in size, reducing clone times and storage requirements. Instead, developers can rely on **`package.json`** and **`package-lock.json`** (or **`yarn.lock`**) to manage dependencies and ensure consistent installations across different environments.
            
        5. **Reproducibility**: **`package.json`** and **`package-lock.json`** (or **`yarn.lock`**) are used to specify and lock down the exact versions of dependencies required by the project. When another developer clones the repository and runs **`npm install`** or **`yarn install`**, the package manager will use these files to install the exact same versions of dependencies, ensuring reproducible builds across different environments.
        
        In summary, **`node_modules`** is a directory created by npm or yarn to store the dependencies of a Node.js project. It is not recommended to include **`node_modules`** in version control, as it can significantly increase the size of the repository. Instead, rely on **`package.json`** and **`package-lock.json`** (or **`yarn.lock`**) to manage dependencies and ensure reproducible builds.
        
    9. What is the `dist` folder?
